            <head>Chapter 5: Diagon Alley</head>

            <p><persName>Harry</persName> woke early the next morning. Although he could tell it was
               daylight, he kept his eyes shut tight. </p>
            <p>“It was a dream,” he told himself firmly. “I dreamed a giant called
                  <persName>Hagrid</persName> came to tell me I was going to a
                  <orgName>school</orgName> for wizards. When I open my eyes I’ll be at home in my
                  <placeName>cupboard</placeName>.” </p>
            <p>There was suddenly a loud tapping noise. And there’s <persName>Aunt
                  Petunia</persName> knocking on the door, <persName>Harry</persName> thought, his
               heart sinking. But he still didn’t open his eyes. It had been such a good dream. Tap.
               Tap. Tap.</p>

            <p>“All right,” <persName>Harry</persName> mumbled, “I’m getting up.”</p>

            <p>He sat up and <persName>Hagrid</persName>’s heavy coat fell off him. The
                  <placeName>hut</placeName> was full of sunlight, the storm was over,
                  <persName>Hagrid</persName> himself was asleep on the collapsed sofa, and there
               was an <objectName>owl</objectName> rapping its claw on the window, a
                  <objectName>newspaper</objectName> held in its beak. Harry scrambled to his feet,
               so happy he felt as though a large balloon was swelling inside him. He went straight
               to the window and jerked it open. The owl swooped in and dropped the newspaper on top
               of Hagrid, who didn’t wake up. The owl then fluttered onto the floor and began to
               attack Hagrid’s coat. </p>
            <p>“Don’t do that.”</p>

            <p><persName>Harry</persName> tried to wave the <objectName>owl</objectName> out of the
               way, but it snapped its beak fiercely at him and carried on savaging the coat. </p>
            <p>“<persName>Hagrid</persName>!” said <persName>Harry</persName> loudly. “There’s an
                  <objectName>owl</objectName> —”</p>

            <p>“Pay him,” <persName>Hagrid</persName> grunted into the sofa.</p>

            <p>“What?”</p>

            <p>“He wants payin’ fer deliverin’ the <objectName>paper</objectName>. Look in the
               pockets.”</p>

            <p><persName/>’s coat seemed to be made of nothing but pockets — bunches of keys, slug
               pellets, balls of string, peppermint humbugs, teabags … finally,
                  <persName>Harry</persName> pulled out a handful of strange-looking coins. </p>
            <p>“Give him <measure>
                  <num>five</num> Knuts</measure>,” said <persName>Hagrid</persName> sleepily.</p>

            <p>“<measure>Knuts</measure>?”</p>

            <p>“The little bronze ones.”</p>

            <p><persName>Harry</persName> counted out <measure>five little bronze coins</measure>,
               and the <objectName>owl</objectName> held out his leg so <persName>Harry</persName>
               could put the money into a small leather pouch tied to it. Then he flew off through
               the open window. <persName>Hagrid</persName> yawned loudly, sat up, and
               stretched.</p>

            <p>“Best be off, <persName>Harry</persName>, lots ter do today, gotta get up ter
                  <placeName>London</placeName> an’ buy all yer stuff fer
               <orgName>school</orgName>.” </p>
            <p><persName>Harry</persName> was turning over the <objectName>wizard coins</objectName>
               and looking at them. He had just thought of something that made him feel as though
               the happy balloon inside him had got a puncture. </p>
            <p>“Um — <persName>Hagrid</persName>?”</p>

            <p>“Mm?” said <persName>Hagrid</persName>, who was pulling on his huge boots.</p>

            <p>“I haven’t got any money — and you heard <persName>Uncle Vernon</persName> last night
               … he won’t pay for me to go and learn magic.” </p>
            <p>“Don’t worry about that,” said <persName>Hagrid</persName>, standing up and
               scratching his head. “D’yeh think yer parents didn’t leave yeh anything?” </p>
            <p>“But if their house was destroyed —” </p>
            <p>“They didn’ keep their gold in the house, boy! Nah, first stop fer us is
                  <placeName>Gringotts</placeName>. <orgName>Wizards’ bank</orgName>. Have a
               sausage, they’re not bad cold — an’ I wouldn’ say no teh a bit o’ yer birthday cake,
               neither.” </p>
            <p>“Wizards have banks?” </p>
            <p>“Just the one. <orgName>Gringotts</orgName>. Run by goblins.” </p>
            <p><persName>Harry</persName> dropped the bit of sausage he was holding. </p>
            <p>“Goblins?”</p>

            <p>“Yeah — so yeh’d be mad ter try an’ rob it, I’ll tell yeh that. Never mess with
               goblins, <persName>Harry</persName>. <placeName>Gringotts</placeName> is the safest
               place in the world fer anything yeh want ter keep safe — ’cept maybe
                  <placeName>Hogwarts</placeName>. As a matter o’ fact, I gotta visit
                  <placeName>Gringotts</placeName> anyway Fer <persName>Dumbledore</persName>.
                  <orgName>Hogwarts</orgName> business.” <persName>Hagrid</persName> drew himself up
               proudly. “He usually gets me ter do important stuff fer him. Fetchin’ you — gettin’
               things from <persName>Gringotts</persName> — knows he can trust me, see. </p>
            <p>“Got everythin’? Come on, then.”</p>

            <p><persName>Harry</persName> followed <persName>Hagrid</persName> out onto the rock.
               The sky was quite clear now and the <placeName>sea</placeName> gleamed in the
               sunlight. The <objectName>boat</objectName>
               <persName>Uncle Vernon</persName> had hired was still there, with a lot of water in
               the bottom after the storm. </p>
            <p>“How did you get here?” <persName>Harry</persName> asked, looking around for another
                  <objectName>boat</objectName>. </p>
            <p>“Flew,” said <persName>Hagrid</persName>.</p>

            <p>“Flew?”</p>

            <p>“Yeah — but we’ll go back in this. Not s’pposed ter use magic now I’ve got yeh.” </p>
            <p>They settled down in the boat, <persName>Harry</persName> still staring at
                  <persName>Hagrid</persName>, trying to imagine him flying. </p>
            <p>“Seems a shame ter row, though,” said <persName>Hagrid</persName>, giving
                  <persName>Harry</persName> another of his sideways looks. “If I was ter — er —
               speed things up a bit, would yeh mind not mentionin’ it at
                  <placeName>Hogwarts</placeName>?” </p>
            <p>“Of course not,” said <persName>Harry</persName>, eager to see more magic.
                  <persName>Hagrid</persName> pulled out the <objectName>pink umbrella</objectName>
               again, tapped it twice on the side of the <objectName>boat</objectName>, and they
               sped off toward land. </p>
            <p>“Why would you be mad to try and rob <objectName>Gringotts</objectName>?”
                  <persName>Harry</persName> asked. </p>
            <p>“Spells — enchantments,” said <persName>Hagrid</persName>, unfolding his
                  <objectName>newspaper</objectName> as he spoke. “They say there’s
                  <objectName>dragons</objectName> guardin’ the <placeName>high-security
                  vaults</placeName>. And then yeh gotta find yer way —
                  <placeName>Gringotts</placeName> is hundreds of miles under
                  <placeName>London</placeName>, see. Deep under the
                  <placeName>Underground</placeName>. Yeh’d die of hunger tryin’ ter get out, even
               if yeh did manage ter get yer hands on summat.” </p>
            <p><persName>Harry</persName> sat and thought about this while
                  <persName>Hagrid</persName> read his <objectName>newspaper</objectName>, the
                  <orgName>Daily Prophet</orgName>. <persName>Harry</persName> had learned from
                  <persName>Uncle Vernon</persName> that people liked to be left alone while they
               did this, but it was very difficult, he’d never had so many questions in his life. </p>
            <p>“<orgName>Ministry o’ Magic</orgName> messin’ things up as usual,”
                  <persName>Hagrid</persName> muttered, turning the page. </p>
            <p>“There’s a <orgName>Ministry of Magic</orgName>?” <persName>Harry</persName> asked,
               before he could stop himself. </p>
            <p>“ ’Course,” said <persName>Hagrid</persName>. “They wanted
                  <persName>Dumbledore</persName> fer Minister, o’ course, but he’d never leave
                  <orgName>Hogwarts</orgName>, so old <persName>Cornelius Fudge</persName> got the
               job. Bungler if ever there was one. So he pelts <persName>Dumbledore</persName> with
                  <objectName>owls</objectName> every morning, askin’ fer advice.” </p>
            <p>“But what does a <orgName>Ministry of Magic</orgName> do?”</p>

            <p>“Well, their main job is to keep it from the Muggles that there’s still witches an’
               wizards up an’ down the country.” </p>
            <p>“Why?”</p>

            <p>“Why? Blimey, <persName>Harry</persName>, everyone’d be wantin’ magic solutions to
               their problems. Nah, we’re best left alone.” </p>
            <p>At this moment the <objectName>boat</objectName> bumped gently into the
                  <placeName>harbor wall</placeName>. <persName>Hagrid</persName> folded up his
                  <objectName>newspaper</objectName>, and they clambered up the stone steps onto the
                  <placeName>street</placeName>. Passersby stared a lot at
                  <persName>Hagrid</persName> as they walked through the <placeName>little
                  town</placeName> to the <placeName>station</placeName>. <persName>Harry</persName>
               couldn’t blame them. Not only was <persName>Hagrid</persName> twice as tall as anyone
               else, he kept pointing at perfectly ordinary things like <objectName>parking
                  meters</objectName> and saying loudly, “See that, <persName>Harry</persName>?
               Things these Muggles dream up, eh?” </p>
            <p>“<persName>Hagrid</persName>,” said <persName>Harry</persName>, panting a bit as he
               ran to keep up, “did you say there are <objectName>dragons</objectName> at
                  <placeName>Gringotts</placeName>?” </p>
            <p>“Well, so they say,” said <persName>Hagrid</persName>. “Crikey, I’d like a
                  <objectName>dragon</objectName>.” </p>
            <p>“You’d like one?”</p>
            <p> “Wanted one ever since I was a kid — here we go.”</p>

            <p>They had reached the <placeName>station</placeName>. There was a
                  <objectName>train</objectName> to <placeName>London</placeName> in five minutes’
               time. <persName>Hagrid</persName>, who didn’t understand “Muggle money,” as he called
               it, gave the bills to <persName>Harry</persName> so he could buy their tickets.
               People stared more than ever on the train. <persName>Hagrid</persName> took up two
               seats and sat knitting what looked like a canary-yellow circus tent. </p>
            <p>“Still got yer letter, <persName>Harry</persName>?” he asked as he counted
               stitches.</p>

            <p><persName>Harry</persName> took the parchment envelope out of his pocket.</p>

            <p>“Good,” said <persName>Hagrid</persName>. “There’s a list there of everything yeh
               need.”</p>

            <p><persName>Harry</persName> unfolded a second piece of paper he hadn’t noticed the
               night before, and read:</p>



            <p><orgName>HOGWARTS SCHOOL</orgName></p>

            <p>“Can we buy all this in <placeName>London</placeName>?” <persName>Harry</persName>
               wondered aloud.</p>

            <p>“If yeh know where to go,” said <persName>Hagrid</persName>.</p>



            <p><persName>Harry</persName> had never been to <placeName>London</placeName> before.
               Although <persName>Hagrid</persName> seemed to know where he was going, he was
               obviously not used to getting there in an ordinary way. He got stuck in the ticket
               barrier on the <placeName>Underground</placeName>, and complained loudly that the
               seats were too small and the trains too slow. </p>
            <p>“I don’t know how the Muggles manage without magic,” he said as they climbed a
               broken-down escalator that led up to a <placeName>bustling road</placeName> lined
               with shops. </p>
            <p><persName>Hagrid</persName> was so huge that he parted the crowd easily; all
                  <persName>Harry</persName> had to do was keep close behind him. They passed
                  <placeName>book shops</placeName> and <placeName>music stores</placeName>,
                  <placeName>hamburger restaurants</placeName> and <placeName>cinemas</placeName>,
               but nowhere that looked as if it could sell you a <objectName>magic
               wand</objectName>. This was just an ordinary street full of ordinary people. Could
               there really be piles of wizard gold buried miles beneath them? Were there really
               shops that sold <objectName>spell books</objectName> and
                  <objectName>broomsticks</objectName>? Might this not all be some huge joke that
               the <persName>Dursleys</persName> had cooked up? If <persName>Harry</persName> hadn’t
               known that the <persName>Dursleys</persName> had no sense of humor, he might have
               thought so; yet somehow, even though everything <persName>Hagrid</persName> had told
               him so far was unbelievable, <persName>Harry</persName> couldn’t help trusting him. </p>
            <p>“This is it,” said <persName>Hagrid</persName>, coming to a halt, “the
                  <placeName>Leaky Cauldron</placeName>. It’s a famous place.” </p>
            <p>It was a tiny, grubby-looking <placeName>pub</placeName>. If
                  <persName>Hagrid</persName> hadn’t pointed it out, <persName>Harry</persName>
               wouldn’t have noticed it was there. The people hurrying by didn’t glance at it. Their
               eyes slid from the <placeName>big book shop</placeName> on one side to the
                  <placeName>record shop</placeName> on the other as if they couldn’t see the
                  <placeName>Leaky Cauldron</placeName> at all. In fact, <persName>Harry</persName>
               had the most peculiar feeling that only he and <persName>Hagrid</persName> could see
               it. Before he could mention this, <persName>Hagrid</persName> had steered him inside.
               For a famous place, it was very dark and shabby. A few old women were sitting in a
               corner, drinking tiny glasses of sherry. One of them was smoking a long pipe. A
               little man in a top hat was talking to the old bartender, who was quite bald and
               looked like a toothless walnut. The low buzz of chatter stopped when they walked in.
               Everyone seemed to know <persName>Hagrid</persName>; they waved and smiled at him,
               and the bartender reached for a glass, saying, “The usual,
                  <persName>Hagrid</persName>?” </p>
            <p>“Can’t, <persName>Tom</persName>, I’m on <orgName>Hogwarts</orgName> business,” said
                  <persName>Hagrid</persName>, clapping his great hand on
               <persName>Harry</persName>’s shoulder and making <persName>Harry</persName>’s knees
               buckle. </p>
            <p>“Good Lord,” said the bartender, peering at <persName>Harry</persName>, “is this —
               can this be — ?” </p>
            <p>The <placeName>Leaky Cauldron</placeName> had suddenly gone completely still and
               silent. </p>
            <p>“Bless my soul,” whispered the old bartender, “<persName>Harry Potter</persName> …
               what an honor.” </p>
            <p>He hurried out from behind the bar, rushed toward <persName>Harry</persName> and
               seized his hand, tears in his eyes. </p>
            <p>“Welcome back,<persName> Mr. Potter</persName>, welcome back.” </p>
            <p><persName>Harry</persName> didn’t know what to say. Everyone was looking at him. The
               old woman with the pipe was puffing on it without realizing it had gone out.
                  <persName>Hagrid</persName> was beaming. Then there was a great scraping of chairs
               and the next moment, <persName>Harry</persName> found himself shaking hands with
               everyone in the <placeName>Leaky Cauldron</placeName>. </p>
            <p>“<persName>Doris Crockford</persName>, <persName>Mr. Potter</persName>, can’t believe
               I’m meeting you at last.” </p>
            <p>“So proud, <persName>Mr. Potter</persName>, I’m just so proud.” </p>
            <p>“Always wanted to shake your hand — I’m all of a flutter.” </p>
            <p>“Delighted, <persName>Mr. Potter</persName>, just can’t tell you,
                  <persName>Diggle</persName>’s the name, <persName>Dedalus Diggle</persName>.” </p>
            <p>“I’ve seen you before!” said <persName>Harry</persName>, as <persName>Dedalus
                  Diggle</persName>’s top hat fell off in his excitement. “You bowed to me once in a
               shop.” </p>
            <p>“He remembers!” cried <persName>Dedalus Diggle</persName>, looking around at
               everyone. “Did you hear that? He remembers me!” </p>
            <p><persName>Harry</persName> shook hands again and again — <persName>Doris
                  Crockford</persName> kept coming back for more. A pale young man made his way
               forward, very nervously. One of his eyes was twitching. </p>
            <p>“<persName>Professor Quirrell</persName>!” said <persName>Hagrid</persName>.
                  “<persName>Harry</persName>, <persName>Professor Quirrell</persName> will be one
               of your teachers at <placeName>Hogwarts</placeName>.” </p>
            <p>“<persName>P-P-Potter</persName>,” stammered <persName>Professor Quirrell</persName>,
               grasping <persName>Harry</persName>’s hand, “c-can’t t-tell you how p-pleased I am to
               meet you.” </p>
            <p>“What sort of magic do you teach, <persName>Professor Quirrell</persName>?” </p>
            <p>“D-Defense Against the D-D-Dark Arts,” muttered <persName>Professor
                  Quirrell</persName>, as though he’d rather not think about it. “N-not that you
               n-need it, eh, <persName>P-P-Potter</persName>?” He laughed nervously. “You’ll be
               g-getting all your equipment, I suppose? I’ve g-got to p-pick up a new b-book on
               vampires, m-myself.” He looked terrified at the very thought. </p>
            <p>But the others wouldn’t let <persName>Professor Quirrell</persName> keep
                  <persName>Harry</persName> to himself. It took almost ten minutes to get away from
               them all. At last, <persName>Hagrid</persName> managed to make himself heard over the
               babble. </p>
            <p>“Must get on — lots ter buy. Come on, <persName>Harry</persName>.” </p>
            <p><persName>Doris Crockford</persName> shook <persName>Harry</persName>’s hand one last
               time, and <persName>Hagrid</persName> led them through the bar and out into a small,
               walled courtyard, where there was nothing but a trash can and a few weeds.
                  <persName>Hagrid</persName> grinned at <persName>Harry</persName>. </p>
            <p>“Told yeh, didn’t I? Told yeh you was famous. Even <persName>Professor
                  Quirrell</persName> was tremblin’ ter meet yeh — mind you, he’s usually
               tremblin’.” </p>
            <p>“Is he always that nervous?”</p>

            <p>“Oh, yeah. Poor bloke. Brilliant mind. He was fine while he was studyin’ outta books
               but then he took a year off ter get some firsthand experience. … They say he met
               vampires in the <placeName>Black Forest</placeName>, and there was a nasty bit o’
               trouble with a hag — never been the same since. Scared of the students, scared of his
               own subject — now, where’s me <objectName>umbrella</objectName>?” </p>
            <p>Vampires? Hags? <persName>Harry</persName>’s head was swimming.
                  <persName>Hagrid</persName>, meanwhile, was counting bricks in the wall above the
               trash can. </p>
            <p>“<measure><num>Three</num></measure> up … <measure><num>two</num></measure> across …”
               he muttered. “Right, stand back, <persName>Harry</persName>.” </p>
            <p>He tapped the wall <measure><num>three</num></measure> times with the point of his
                  <objectName>umbrella</objectName>. The brick he had touched quivered — it wriggled
               — in the middle, a small hole appeared — it grew wider and wider — a second later
               they were facing an archway large enough even for <persName>Hagrid</persName>, an
               archway onto a cobbled street that twisted and turned out of sight. </p>
            <p>“Welcome,” said <persName>Hagrid</persName>, “to <placeName>Diagon
               Alley</placeName>.”</p>

            <p>He grinned at <persName>Harry</persName>’s amazement. They stepped through the
               archway. <persName>Harry</persName> looked quickly over his shoulder and saw the
               archway shrink instantly back into solid wall. The sun shone brightly on a stack of
               cauldrons outside the nearest shop. Cauldrons — All Sizes — Copper, Brass, Pewter,
               Silver — Self-Stirring — Collapsible, said a sign hanging over them. </p>
            <p>“Yeah, you’ll be needin’ one,” said <persName>Hagrid</persName>, “but we gotta get
               yer <objectName>money</objectName> first.” </p>
            <p><persName>Harry</persName> wished he had about <measure><num>eight</num></measure>
               more eyes. He turned his head in every direction as they walked up the
                  <placeName>street</placeName>, trying to look at everything at once: the shops,
               the things outside them, the people doing their shopping. A plump woman outside an
                  <placeName>Apothecary</placeName> was shaking her head as they passed, saying,
               “Dragon liver, <measure><num>sixteen Sickles an ounce</num></measure>, they’re mad.”
               A low, soft hooting came from a <placeName>dark shop</placeName> with a sign saying
                  <placeName>Eeylops Owl Emporium</placeName> — Tawny, Screech, Barn, Brown, and
               Snowy. Several boys of about <persName>Harry</persName>’s age had their noses pressed
               against a window with <objectName>broomsticks</objectName> in it. “Look,”
                  <persName>Harry</persName> heard one of them say, “the new <objectName>Nimbus Two
                  Thousand</objectName> — fastest ever —” There were shops selling
                  <objectName>robes</objectName>, shops selling <objectName>telescopes</objectName>
               and <objectName>strange silver instruments</objectName>
               <persName>Harry</persName> had never seen before, windows stacked with
                  <objectName>barrels of bat spleens</objectName> and <objectName>eels’
                  eyes</objectName>, tottering piles of <objectName>spell books</objectName>,
                  <objectName>quills</objectName>, and <objectName>rolls of parchment</objectName>,
                  <objectName>potion bottles</objectName>, <objectName>globes of the
                  moon</objectName>. … </p>
            <p>“<placeName>Gringotts</placeName>,” said <persName>Hagrid</persName>. </p>
            <p>They had reached a <placeName>snowy white building</placeName> that towered over the
                  <placeName>other little shops</placeName>. Standing beside its burnished bronze
               doors, wearing a uniform of scarlet and gold, was — </p>
            <p>“Yeah, that’s a goblin,” said <persName>Hagrid</persName> quietly as they walked up
               the white stone steps toward him. The goblin was about a head shorter than
                  <persName>Harry</persName>. He had a swarthy, clever face, a pointed beard and,
                  <persName>Harry</persName> noticed, very long fingers and feet. He bowed as they
               walked inside. Now they were facing a second pair of doors, silver this time, with
               words engraved upon them: </p>


            <lg>
               <l>Enter, stranger, but take heed</l>

               <l>Of what awaits the sin of greed, </l>
               <l>For those who take, but do not earn,</l>

               <l>Must pay most dearly in their turn.</l>

               <l>So if you seek beneath our floors</l>

               <l>A treasure that was never yours,</l>

               <l>Thief, you have been warned, beware</l>

               <l>Of finding more than treasure there.</l>
            </lg>



            <p>“Like I said, yeh’d be mad ter try an’ rob it,” said <persName>Hagrid</persName>.</p>

            <p>A pair of goblins bowed them through the silver doors and they were in a vast marble
               hall. About a <measure><num>hundred</num></measure> more goblins were sitting on high
               stools behind a long counter, scribbling in large <objectName>ledgers</objectName>,
               weighing <objectName>coins</objectName> in brass scales, examining
                  <objectName>precious stones</objectName> through eyeglasses. There were too many
               doors to count leading off the hall, and yet more goblins were showing people in and
               out of these. <persName>Hagrid</persName> and <persName>Harry</persName> made for the
               counter. </p>
            <p>“Morning,” said <persName>Hagrid</persName> to a free goblin. “We’ve come ter take
               some money outta <persName>Mr. Harry Potter</persName>’s
               <placeName>safe</placeName>.” </p>
            <p>“You have his key, sir?” </p>
            <p>“Got it here somewhere,” said <persName>Hagrid</persName>, and he started emptying
               his pockets onto the counter, scattering a handful of moldy dog biscuits over the
               goblins book of numbers. The goblin wrinkled his nose. <persName>Harry</persName>
               watched the goblin on their right weighing a pile of rubies as big as glowing coals. </p>
            <p>“Got it,” said <persName>Hagrid</persName> at last, holding up a <objectName>tiny
                  golden key</objectName>. </p>
            <p>The goblin looked at it closely. </p>
            <p>“That seems to be in order.”</p>

            <p>“An’ I’ve also got a <objectName>letter</objectName> here from <persName>Professor
                  Dumbledore</persName>,” said <persName>Hagrid</persName> importantly, throwing out
               his chest. “It’s about the You-Know-What in <placeName>vault seven hundred and
                  thirteen</placeName>.” </p>
            <p>The goblin read the letter carefully. </p>
            <p>“Very well,” he said, handing it back to <persName>Hagrid</persName>, “I will have
               someone take you down to both <placeName>vaults</placeName>.
                  <persName>Griphook</persName>!” </p>
            <p><persName>Griphook</persName> was yet another goblin. Once
                  <persName>Hagrid</persName> had crammed all the dog biscuits back inside his
               pockets, he and <persName>Harry</persName> followed <persName>Griphook</persName>
               toward one of the doors leading off the <placeName>hall</placeName>. </p>
            <p>“What’s the You-Know-What in <placeName>vault seven hundred and
               thirteen</placeName>?” <persName>Harry</persName> asked. </p>
            <p>“Can’t tell yeh that,” said <persName>Hagrid</persName> mysteriously. “Very secret.
                  <orgName>Hogwarts</orgName> business. <persName>Dumbledore</persName>’s trusted
               me. More’n my job’s worth ter tell yeh that.” </p>
            <p><persName>Griphook</persName> held the door open for them.
               <persName>Harry</persName>, who had expected more marble, was surprised. They were in
               a <placeName>narrow stone passageway</placeName> lit with flaming torches. It sloped
               steeply downward and there were little railway tracks on the floor.
                  <persName>Griphook</persName> whistled and a small cart came hurtling up the
               tracks toward them. They climbed in — <persName>Hagrid</persName> with some
               difficulty — and were off. At first they just hurtled through a <placeName>maze of
                  twisting passages</placeName>. <persName>Harry</persName> tried to remember, left,
               right, right, left, middle fork, right, left, but it was impossible. The rattling
               cart seemed to know its own way, because <persName>Griphook</persName> wasn’t
               steering. <persName>Harry</persName>’s eyes stung as the cold air rushed past them,
               but he kept them wide open. Once, he thought he saw a burst of fire at the end of a
               passage and twisted around to see if it was a dragon, but too late — they plunged
               even deeper, passing an <placeName>underground lake</placeName> where huge
               stalactites and stalagmites grew from the ceiling and floor. </p>
            <p>“I never know,” <persName>Harry</persName> called to <persName>Hagrid</persName> over
               the noise of the cart, “what’s the difference between a stalagmite and a stalactite?” </p>
            <p>“Stalagmite’s got an ‘m’ in it,” said <persName>Hagrid</persName>. “An’ don’ ask me
               questions just now, I think I’m gonna be sick.” </p>
            <p>He did look very green, and when the cart stopped at last beside a small door in the
               passage wall, <persName>Hagrid</persName> got out and had to lean against the wall to
               stop his knees from trembling. <persName>Griphook</persName> unlocked the door. A lot
               of green smoke came billowing out, and as it cleared, <persName>Harry</persName>
               gasped. Inside were <objectName><measure>mounds of gold coins</measure></objectName>.
                     <objectName><measure>Columns of silver</measure></objectName>. Heaps of
                     <objectName><measure>little bronze Knuts</measure></objectName>. </p>
            <p>“All yours,” smiled <persName>Hagrid</persName>.</p>

            <p>All <persName>Harry</persName>’s — it was incredible. The
                  <persName>Dursleys</persName> couldn’t have known about this or they’d have had it
               from him faster than blinking. How often had they complained how much
                  <persName>Harry</persName> cost them to keep? And all the time there had been a
               small fortune belonging to him, buried <placeName>deep under London</placeName>.
                  <persName>Hagrid</persName> helped <persName>Harry</persName> pile some of it into
               a bag.</p>

            <p>“The gold ones are <objectName><measure>Galleons</measure></objectName>,” he
               explained. “<num>Seventeen</num>
               <objectName><measure>silver Sickles</measure></objectName> to a
                     <objectName><measure>Galleon</measure></objectName> and
                     <num>twenty-nine</num><measure><objectName> Knuts</objectName></measure> to a
                     <objectName><measure>Sickle</measure></objectName>, it’s easy enough. Right,
               that should be enough fer a couple o’ terms, we’ll keep the rest safe for yeh.” He
               turned to <persName>Griphook</persName>. “<placeName>Vault seven hundred and
                  thirteen</placeName> now, please, and can we go more slowly?” </p>
            <p>“One speed only,” said <persName>Griphook</persName>.</p>

            <p>They were going even deeper now and gathering speed. The air became colder and colder
               as they hurtled round tight corners. They went rattling over an
                  <placeName>underground ravine</placeName>, and <persName>Harry</persName> leaned
               over the side to try to see what was down at the dark bottom, but
                  <persName>Hagrid</persName> groaned and pulled him back by the scruff of his neck.
                  <placeName>Vault seven hundred and thirteen</placeName> had no keyhole.</p>

            <p>“Stand back,” said <persName>Griphook</persName> importantly. He stroked the door
               gently with one of his long fingers and it simply melted away. </p>
            <p>“If anyone but a <orgName>Gringotts</orgName> goblin tried that, they’d be sucked
               through the door and trapped in there,” said <persName>Griphook</persName>. </p>
            <p>“How often do you check to see if anyone’s inside?” Harry asked. </p>
            <p>“About once every ten years,” said Griphook with a rather nasty grin. </p>
            <p>Something really extraordinary had to be inside this <placeName>top security
                  vault</placeName>, Harry was sure, and he leaned forward eagerly, expecting to see
               fabulous jewels at the very least — but at first he thought it was empty. Then he
               noticed a <objectName>grubby little package</objectName> wrapped up in brown paper
               lying on the floor. <persName>Hagrid</persName> picked it up and tucked it deep
               inside his coat. <persName>Harry</persName> longed to know what it was, but knew
               better than to ask. </p>
            <p>“Come on, back in this infernal cart, and don’t talk to me on the way back, it’s best
               if I keep me mouth shut,” said <persName>Hagrid</persName>. </p>


            <p>One wild cart ride later they stood blinking in the sunlight outside
                  <placeName>Gringotts</placeName>. <persName>Harry</persName> didn’t know where to
               run first now that he had a <measure><objectName>bag full of
                  money</objectName></measure>. He didn’t have to know how many
                     <objectName><measure>Galleons</measure></objectName> there were to a pound to
               know that he was holding more money than he’d had in his whole life — more money than
               even <persName>Dudley</persName> had ever had. </p>
            <p>“Might as well get yer <objectName>uniform</objectName>,” said
                  <persName>Hagrid</persName>, nodding toward <placeName>Madam Malkin’s Robes for
                  All Occasions</placeName>. “Listen, <persName>Harry</persName>, would yeh mind if
               I slipped off fer a pick-me-up in the <placeName>Leaky Cauldron</placeName>? I hate
               them <orgName>Gringotts</orgName> carts.” He did still look a bit sick, so
                  <persName>Harry</persName> entered Madam Malkin<persName/>’s
                  <placeName>shop</placeName> alone, feeling nervous. </p>
            <p><persName>Madam Malkin</persName> was a squat, smiling witch dressed all in mauve. </p>
            <p>“<orgName>Hogwarts</orgName>, dear?” she said, when <persName>Harry</persName>
               started to speak. “Got the lot here — another young man being fitted up just now, in
               fact.” </p>
            <p>In the <placeName>back of the shop</placeName>, a boy with a pale, pointed face was
               standing on a footstool while a second witch pinned up his <objectName>long black
                  robes</objectName>. <persName>Madam Malkin</persName> stood
                  <persName>Harry</persName> on a stool next to him, slipped a long robe over his
               head, and began to pin it to the right length. </p>
            <p>“Hello,” said the boy, “<orgName>Hogwarts</orgName>, too?” </p>
            <p>“Yes,” said <persName>Harry</persName>.</p>

            <p>“My father’s next door buying my <objectName>books</objectName> and mother’s up the
               street looking at <objectName>wands</objectName>,” said the boy. He had a bored,
               drawling voice. “Then I’m going to drag them off to look at <objectName>racing
                  brooms</objectName>. I don’t see why first years can’t have their own. I think
               I’ll bully father into getting me one and I’ll smuggle it in somehow.” </p>
            <p><persName>Harry</persName> was strongly reminded of <persName>Dudley</persName>.</p>

            <p>“Have you got your own <objectName>broom</objectName>?” the boy went on.</p>

            <p>“No,” said <persName>Harry</persName>.</p>

            <p>“Play Quidditch at all?”</p>

            <p>“No,” <persName>Harry</persName> said again, wondering what on earth Quidditch could
               be.</p>

            <p>“I do — Father says it’s a crime if I’m not picked to play for my House, and I must
               say, I agree. Know what House you’ll be in yet?” </p>
            <p>“No,” said <persName>Harry</persName>, feeling more stupid by the minute. </p>
            <p>“Well, no one really knows until they get there, do they, but I know I’ll be in
                  <orgName>Slytherin</orgName>, all our family have been — imagine being in
                  <orgName>Hufflepuff</orgName>, I think I’d leave, wouldn’t you?” </p>
            <p>“Mmm,” said <persName>Harry</persName>, wishing he could say something a bit more
               interesting. </p>
            <p>“I say, look at that man!” said the boy suddenly, nodding toward the front window.
                  <persName>Hagrid</persName> was standing there, grinning at
                  <persName>Harry</persName> and pointing at <num>two</num>
               <objectName>large ice creams</objectName> to show he couldn’t come in. </p>
            <p>“That’s <persName>Hagrid</persName>,” said <persName>Harry</persName>, pleased to
               know something the boy didn’t. “He works at <placeName>Hogwarts</placeName>.” </p>
            <p>“Oh,” said the boy, “I’ve heard of him. He’s a sort of servant, isn’t he?” </p>
            <p>“He’s the gamekeeper,” said <persName>Harry</persName>. He was liking the boy less
               and less every second. </p>
            <p>“Yes, exactly. I heard he’s a sort of savage — lives in a <placeName>hut on the
                  school grounds</placeName> and every now and then he gets drunk, tries to do
               magic, and ends up setting fire to his bed.” </p>
            <p>“I think he’s brilliant,” said <persName>Harry</persName> coldly. </p>
            <p>“Do you?” said the boy, with a slight sneer. “Why is he with you? Where are your
               parents?” </p>
            <p>“They’re dead,” said <persName>Harry</persName> shortly. He didn’t feel much like
               going into the matter with this boy. </p>
            <p>“Oh, sorry,” said the other, not sounding sorry at all. “But they were our kind,
               weren’t they?” </p>
            <p>“They were a witch and wizard, if that’s what you mean.”</p>

            <p>“I really don’t think they should let the other sort in, do you? They’re just not the
               same, they’ve never been brought up to know our ways. Some of them have never even
               heard of <orgName>Hogwarts</orgName> until they get the
                  <objectName>letter</objectName>, imagine. I think they should keep it in the old
               wizarding families. What’s your surname, anyway?” </p>
            <p>But before <persName>Harry</persName> could answer, <persName>Madam Malkin</persName>
               said, “That’s you done, my dear,” and <persName>Harry</persName>, not sorry for an
               excuse to stop talking to the boy, hopped down from the footstool. </p>
            <p>“Well, I’ll see you at <placeName>Hogwarts</placeName>, I suppose,” said the drawling
               boy. </p>
            <p><persName>Harry</persName> was rather quiet as he ate the ice cream
                  <persName>Hagrid</persName> had bought him (chocolate and raspberry with chopped
               nuts). </p>
            <p>“What’s up?” said <persName>Hagrid</persName>.</p>

            <p>“Nothing,” <persName>Harry</persName> lied. They stopped to buy
                  <objectName>parchment</objectName> and <objectName>quills</objectName>.
                  <persName>Harry</persName> cheered up a bit when he found a <objectName>bottle of
                  ink</objectName> that changed color as you wrote. When they had left the shop, he
               said, “<persName>Hagrid</persName>, what’s Quidditch?” </p>
            <p>“Blimey, <persName>Harry</persName>, I keep forgettin’ how little yeh know — not
               knowin’ about Quidditch!” </p>
            <p>“Don’t make me feel worse,” said <persName>Harry</persName>. He told
                  <persName>Hagrid</persName> about the pale boy in <placeName>Madam
                  Malkin’s</placeName>. </p>
            <p>“— and he said people from Muggle families shouldn’t even be allowed in —” </p>
            <p>“Yer not from a Muggle family. If he’d known who yeh were — he’s grown up knowin’ yer
               name if his parents are wizardin’ folk. You saw what everyone in the <placeName>Leaky
                  Cauldron</placeName> was like when they saw yeh. Anyway, what does he know about
               it, some o’ the best I ever saw were the only ones with magic in ’em in a long line
               o’ Muggles — look at yer mum! Look what she had fer a sister!” </p>
            <p>“So what is Quidditch?”</p>

            <p>“It’s our sport. Wizard sport. It’s like — like soccer in the Muggle world — everyone
               follows Quidditch — played up in the air on <objectName>broomsticks</objectName> and
               there’s four <objectName>balls</objectName> — sorta hard ter explain the rules.” </p>
            <p>“And what are <orgName>Slytherin</orgName> and <orgName>Hufflepuff</orgName>?”</p>

            <p>“School Houses. There’s four. Everyone says <orgName>Hufflepuff</orgName> are a lot
               o’ duffers, but —” </p>
            <p>“I bet I’m in <orgName>Hufflepuff</orgName>,” said <persName>Harry</persName>
               gloomily.</p>

            <p>“Better <orgName>Hufflepuff</orgName> than <orgName>Slytherin</orgName>,” said Hagrid
               darkly. “There’s not a single witch or wizard who went bad who wasn’t in
                  <orgName>Slytherin</orgName>. <persName>You-Know-Who</persName> was one.” </p>
            <p>“Vol-, sorry — <persName>You-Know-Who</persName> was at
                  <placeName>Hogwarts</placeName>?”</p>
            <p> “Years an’ years ago,” said <persName>Hagrid</persName>.</p>

            <p>They bought <persName>Harry</persName>’s <objectName>school books</objectName> in a
               shop called <placeName>Flourish and Blotts</placeName> where the shelves were stacked
               to the ceiling with <objectName>books</objectName> as large as paving stones bound in
               leather; books the size of postage stamps in covers of silk; books full of peculiar
               symbols and a few books with nothing in them at all. Even
               <persName>Dudley</persName>, who never read anything, would have been wild to get his
               hands on some of these. <persName>Hagrid</persName> almost had to drag
                  <persName>Harry</persName> away from C<title>urses and Counter-curses (Bewitch
                  Your Friends and Befuddle Your Enemies with the Latest Revenges: Hair Loss,
                  Jelly-Legs, Tongue-Tying and Much, Much More) by</title>
               <persName>Professor Vindictus Viridian</persName>. </p>
            <p>“I was trying to find out how to curse <persName>Dudley</persName>.”</p>

            <p>“I’m not sayin’ that’s not a good idea, but yer not ter use magic in the Muggle world
               except in very special circumstances,” said <persName>Hagrid</persName>. “An’ anyway,
               yeh couldn’ work any of them curses yet, yeh’ll need a lot more study before yeh get
               ter that level.” </p>
            <p><persName>Hagrid</persName> wouldn’t let <persName>Harry</persName> buy a
                  <objectName>solid gold cauldron</objectName>, either (“It says pewter on yer
               list”), but they got a nice set of <objectName>scales</objectName> for weighing
               potion ingredients and a <objectName>collapsible brass telescope</objectName>. Then
               they visited the <placeName>Apothecary</placeName>, which was fascinating enough to
               make up for its horrible smell, a mixture of bad eggs and rotted cabbages.
                  <objectName>Barrels of slimy stuff</objectName> stood on the floor;
                  <objectName>jars of herbs, dried roots, and bright powders</objectName> lined the
               walls; <objectName>bundles of feathers</objectName>, <objectName>strings of
                  fangs</objectName>, and <objectName>snarled claws</objectName> hung from the
               ceiling. While <persName>Hagrid</persName> asked the man behind the counter for a
               supply of some <objectName>basic potion ingredients</objectName> for
                  <persName>Harry</persName>, <persName>Harry</persName> himself examined
                  <objectName>silver unicorn horns</objectName> at <measure><num>twenty-one
                     Galleons</num></measure> each and <objectName>minuscule, glittery-black beetle
                  eyes</objectName> (<measure><num>five Knuts a scoop</num></measure>). Outside the
                  <placeName>Apothecary</placeName>, <persName>Hagrid</persName> checked
                  <persName>Harry</persName>’s list again. </p>
            <p>“Just yer <objectName>wand</objectName> left — oh yeah, an’ I still haven’t got yeh a
               birthday present.” </p>
            <p><persName>Harry</persName> felt himself go red.</p>
            <p> “You don’t have to —”</p>

            <p>“I know I don’t have to. Tell yeh what, I’ll get yer animal. Not a toad, toads went
               outta fashion years ago, yeh’d be laughed at — an’ I don’ like cats, they make me
               sneeze. I’ll get yer an owl. All the kids want owls, they’re dead useful, carry yer
                  <objectName>mail</objectName> an’ everythin’.” </p>
            <p>Twenty minutes later, they left <placeName>Eeylops Owl Emporium</placeName>, which
               had been dark and full of rustling and flickering, jewel-bright eyes.
                  <persName>Harry</persName> now carried a <objectName>large cage</objectName> that
               held a beautiful snowy owl<objectName/>, fast asleep with her head under her wing. He
               couldn’t stop stammering his thanks, sounding just like <persName>Professor
                  Quirrell</persName>. </p>
            <p>“Don’ mention it,” said <persName>Hagrid</persName> gruffly. “Don’ expect you’ve had
               a lotta presents from them <persName>Dursleys</persName>. Just
                  <placeName>Ollivanders</placeName> left now — only place fer
                  <objectName>wands</objectName>, <placeName>Ollivanders</placeName>, and yeh gotta
               have the best <objectName>wand</objectName>.” </p>
            <p>A <objectName>magic wand</objectName> … this was what <persName>Harry</persName> had
               been really looking forward to. The last <placeName>shop</placeName> was narrow and
               shabby. Peeling gold letters over the door read <orgName>Ollivanders: Makers of Fine
                  Wands</orgName> since 382b.c. A single wand lay on a faded purple cushion in the
               dusty window. A tinkling bell rang somewhere in the depths of the shop as they
               stepped inside. It was a tiny place, empty except for a single, spindly chair that
                  <persName>Hagrid</persName> sat on to wait. <persName>Harry</persName> felt
               strangely as though he had entered a very strict library; he swallowed a lot of new
               questions that had just occurred to him and looked instead at the thousands of narrow
               boxes piled neatly right up to the ceiling. For some reason, the back of his neck
               prickled. The very dust and silence in here seemed to tingle with some secret magic. </p>
            <p>“Good afternoon,” said a soft voice. <persName>Harry</persName> jumped.
                  <persName>Hagrid</persName> must have jumped, too, because there was a loud
               crunching noise and he got quickly off the spindly chair. </p>
            <p>An old man was standing before them, his wide, pale eyes shining like moons through
               the gloom of the shop. </p>
            <p>“Hello,” said <persName>Harry</persName> awkwardly. </p>
            <p>“Ah yes,” said the man. “Yes, yes. I thought I’d be seeing you soon. <persName>Harry
                  Potter</persName>.” It wasn’t a question. “You have your mother’s eyes. It seems
               only yesterday she was in here herself, buying her first wand. <measure><num>Ten and
                     a quarter inches long</num></measure>, swishy, made of willow. Nice wand for
               charm work.” </p>
            <p><persName>Mr. Ollivander</persName> moved closer to <persName>Harry</persName>.
                  <persName>Harry</persName> wished he would blink. Those silvery eyes were a bit
               creepy. </p>
            <p>“Your father, on the other hand, favored a mahogany wand. <measure><num>Eleven
                     inches</num></measure>. Pliable. A little more power and excellent for
               transfiguration. Well, I say your father favored it — it’s really the wand that
               chooses the wizard, of course.” </p>
            <p><persName>Mr. Ollivander</persName> had come so close that he and
                  <persName>Harry</persName> were almost nose to nose. <persName>Harry</persName>
               could see himself reflected in those misty eyes. </p>
            <p>“And that’s where …”</p>

            <p><persName>Mr. Ollivander</persName> touched the lightning scar on
                  <persName>Harry</persName>’s forehead with a long, white finger. </p>
            <p>“I’m sorry to say I sold the wand that did it,” he said softly.
                     “<measure><num>Thirteen-and-a-half inches</num></measure>. Yew. Powerful wand,
               very powerful, and in the wrong hands … well, if I’d known what that wand was going
               out into the world to do. …” </p>
            <p>He shook his head and then, to <persName>Harry</persName>’s relief, spotted
                  <persName>Hagrid</persName>. </p>
            <p>“<persName>Rubeus</persName>! <persName>Rubeus Hagrid</persName>! How nice to see you
               again. … Oak, <measure><num>sixteen inches,</num></measure> rather bendy, wasn’t it?” </p>
            <p>“It was, sir, yes,” said <persName>Hagrid</persName>. </p>
            <p>“Good <objectName>wand</objectName>, that one. But I suppose they snapped it in half
               when you got expelled?” said <persName>Mr. Ollivander</persName>, suddenly stern. </p>
            <p>“Er — yes, they did, yes,” said <persName>Hagrid</persName>, shuffling his feet.
               “I’ve still got the pieces, though,” he added brightly. </p>
            <p>“But you don’t use them?” said <persName>Mr. Ollivander</persName> sharply. </p>
            <p>“Oh, no, sir,” said <persName>Hagrid</persName> quickly. <persName>Harry</persName>
               noticed he gripped his <objectName>pink umbrella</objectName> very tightly as he
               spoke. </p>
            <p>“Hmmm,” said <persName>Mr. Ollivander</persName>, giving <persName>Hagrid</persName>
               a piercing look. “Well, now — <persName>Mr. Potter</persName>. Let me see.” He pulled
               a <objectName>long tape measure with silver markings</objectName> out of his pocket.
               “Which is your wand arm?” </p>
            <p>“Er — well, I’m right-handed,” said <persName>Harry</persName>. </p>
            <p>“Hold out your arm. That’s it.” He measured <persName>Harry</persName> from shoulder
               to finger, then wrist to elbow, shoulder to floor, knee to armpit and round his head.
               As he measured, he said, “Every <orgName>Ollivander</orgName> wand has a core of a
               powerful magical substance, <persName>Mr. Potter</persName>. We use
                  <objectName>unicorn hairs</objectName>, <objectName>phoenix tail
                  feathers</objectName>, and the <objectName>heartstrings of dragons</objectName>.
               No two <objectName>
                  <orgName>Ollivander</orgName> wands</objectName> are the same, just as no two
               unicorns, dragons, or phoenixes are quite the same. And of course, you will never get
               such good results with another wizard’s wand.” </p>
            <p><persName>Harry</persName> suddenly realized that the <objectName>tape
                  measure</objectName>, which was measuring between his nostrils, was doing this on
               its own. <persName>Mr. Ollivander</persName> was flitting around the shelves, taking
               down boxes. </p>
            <p>“That will do,” he said, and the tape measure crumpled into a heap on the floor.
               “Right then, <persName>Mr. Potter</persName>. Try this one. Beech-wood and dragon
               heartstring. <measure><num>Nine inches</num></measure>. Nice and flexible. Just take
               it and give it a wave.” </p>
            <p><persName>Harry</persName> took the wand and (feeling foolish) waved it around a bit,
               but <persName>Mr. Ollivander</persName> snatched it out of his hand almost at once. </p>
            <p>“Maple and phoenix feather. <measure><num>Seven inches</num></measure>. Quite whippy.
               Try —” </p>
            <p><persName>Harry</persName> tried — but he had hardly raised the wand when it, too,
               was snatched back by <persName>Mr. Ollivander</persName>. </p>
            <p>“No, no — here, ebony and unicorn hair, <measure><num>eight and a half
                  inches</num></measure>, springy. Go on, go on, try it out.” </p>
            <p><persName>Harry</persName> tried. And tried. He had no idea what <persName>Mr.
                  Ollivander</persName> was waiting for. The pile of tried
                  <objectName>wands</objectName> was mounting higher and higher on the spindly
               chair, but the more wands <persName>Mr. Ollivander</persName> pulled from the
               shelves, the happier he seemed to become. </p>
            <p>“Tricky customer, eh? Not to worry, we’ll find the perfect match here somewhere — I
               wonder, now — yes, why not — unusual combination — holly and phoenix feather,
                     <measure><num>eleven inches</num></measure>, nice and supple.” </p>
            <p><persName>Harry</persName> took the wand. He felt a sudden warmth in his fingers. He
               raised the <objectName>wand</objectName> above his head, brought it swishing down
               through the dusty air and a stream of red and gold sparks shot from the end like a
               firework, throwing dancing spots of light on to the walls.
                  <persName>Hagrid</persName> whooped and clapped and <persName>Mr.
                  Ollivander</persName> cried, “Oh, bravo! Yes, indeed, oh, very good. Well, well,
               well … how curious … how very curious …” He put <persName>Harry</persName>’s
                  <objectName>wand</objectName> back into its box and wrapped it in brown paper,
               still muttering, “Curious … curious …” </p>
            <p>“Sorry,” said <persName>Harry</persName>, “but what’s curious?”</p>

            <p><persName>Mr. Ollivander</persName> fixed <persName>Harry</persName> with his pale
               stare.</p>

            <p>“I remember every wand I’ve ever sold, <persName>Mr. Potter</persName>. Every single
               wand. It so happens that the phoenix whose tail feather is in your wand, gave another
               feather — just one other. It is very curious indeed that you should be destined for
               this wand when its brother — why, its brother gave you that scar.” </p>
            <p><persName>Harry</persName> swallowed.</p>

            <p>“Yes, <measure><num>thirteen-and-a-half inches</num></measure>. Yew. Curious indeed
               how these things happen. The wand chooses the wizard, remember. … I think we must
               expect great things from you, <persName>Mr. Potter</persName>. … After all,
                  <persName>He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named</persName> did great things — terrible, yes,
               but great.” </p>
            <p><persName>Harry</persName> shivered. He wasn’t sure he liked <persName>Mr.
                  Ollivander</persName> too much. He paid <measure><num>seven gold
                  Galleons</num></measure> for his <objectName>wand</objectName>, and<persName> Mr.
                  Ollivander</persName> bowed them from his <placeName>shop</placeName>. </p>


            <p>The late afternoon sun hung low in the sky as <persName>Harry</persName> and
                  <persName>Hagrid</persName> made their way back down <placeName>Diagon
                  Alley</placeName>, back through the <placeName>wall</placeName>, back through the
                  <placeName>Leaky Cauldron</placeName>, now empty. <persName>Harry</persName>
               didn’t speak at all as they walked down the <placeName>road</placeName>; he didn’t
               even notice how much people were gawking at them on the
                  <placeName>Underground</placeName>, laden as they were with all their
                  <objectName>funny-shaped packages</objectName>, with the <objectName>snowy
                  owl</objectName> asleep in its cage on <persName>Harry</persName>’s lap. Up
               another escalator, out into <placeName>Paddington station</placeName>;
                  <persName>Harry</persName> only realized where they were when
                  <persName>Hagrid</persName> tapped him on the shoulder. </p>
            <p>“Got time fer a bite to eat before yer train leaves,” he said. </p>
            <p>He bought <persName>Harry</persName> a hamburger and they sat down on plastic seats
               to eat them. <persName>Harry</persName> kept looking around. Everything looked so
               strange, somehow. </p>
            <p>“You all right, <persName>Harry</persName>? Yer very quiet,” said
                  <persName>Hagrid</persName>. </p>
            <p><persName>Harry</persName> wasn’t sure he could explain. He’d just had the best
               birthday of his life — and yet — he chewed his hamburger, trying to find the words. </p>
            <p>“Everyone thinks I’m special,” he said at last. “All those people in the
                  <placeName>Leaky Cauldron</placeName>, <persName>Professor Quirrell</persName>,
                  <persName>Mr. Ollivander</persName> … but I don’t know anything about magic at
               all. How can they expect great things? I’m famous and I can’t even remember what I’m
               famous for. I don’t know what happened when <persName>Vol</persName>-, sorry — I
               mean, the night my parents died.” </p>
            <p><persName>Hagrid</persName> leaned across the table. Behind the wild beard and
               eyebrows he wore a very kind smile. </p>
            <p>“Don’ you worry, <persName>Harry</persName>. You’ll learn fast enough. Everyone
               starts at the beginning at <placeName>Hogwarts</placeName>, you’ll be just fine. Just
               be yerself. I know it’s hard. Yeh’ve been singled out, an’ that’s always hard. But
               yeh’ll have a great time at <placeName>Hogwarts</placeName> — I did — still do,
               ’smatter of fact.” </p>
            <p><persName>Hagrid</persName> helped <persName>Harry</persName> on to the
                  <placeName>train</placeName> that would take him back to the
                  <persName>Dursleys</persName>, then handed him an
                  <objectName>envelope</objectName>. </p>
            <p>“Yer <objectName>ticket</objectName> fer <orgName>Hogwarts</orgName>,” he said.
               “First o’ September — <placeName>King’s Cross</placeName> — it’s all on yer
                  <objectName>ticket</objectName>. Any problems with the
                  <persName>Dursleys</persName>, send me a <objectName>letter</objectName> with yer
                  <objectName>owl</objectName>, she’ll know where to find me. … See yeh soon,
                  <persName>Harry</persName>.” </p>
            <p>The <objectName>train</objectName> pulled out of the <placeName>station</placeName>.
                  <persName>Harry</persName> wanted to watch <persName>Hagrid</persName> until he
               was out of sight; he rose in his seat and pressed his nose against the window, but he
               blinked and <persName>Hagrid</persName> had gone. </p>
